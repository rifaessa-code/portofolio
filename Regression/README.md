## 🗂 Regression & Structural Modeling Techniques

### **1. Simple Linear Regression (SPSS)**
- One predictor, one outcome  
- Coefficient interpretation  
- R² and goodness-of-fit  
- Residual diagnostics  

---

### **2. Multiple Linear Regression (SPSS)**
- Multiple predictors  
- Assumption checks (normality, VIF, homoscedasticity)  
- ANOVA model significance  
- Coefficient interpretation  
- Adjusted R²  

---

### **3. Binary Logistic Regression (SPSS)**
- Binary outcome (0/1)  
- Odds ratios  
- Wald test  
- Hosmer–Lemeshow test  
- ROC curve (if included)  

---

### **4. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) — RStudio**
- Nonlinear modeling  
- Hinge functions and basis functions  
- Variable importance ranking  
- Error metrics (GCV, RMSE)  
- Partial dependence plots  

---

### **5. Path Analysis (SPSS)**
Path Analysis evaluates **direct and indirect effects** among variables in a causal structure.

The analysis includes:
- Designing path diagrams  
- Estimating standardized & unstandardized coefficients  
- Decomposing direct vs indirect effects  
- Significance testing for each pathway  

Outputs may include:
- Path diagrams  
- Coefficients tables  
- Effect decomposition summaries  

---

### **6. Moderation Regression (SPSS)**  
Moderation Regression (Regresi Moderasi) is used to test whether the relationship between an independent variable (X) and dependent variable (Y) changes depending on a moderator variable (M).

The workflow includes:
- Centering variables (optional but recommended to reduce multicollinearity)  
- Creating interaction term:  
  - **X * M**  
- Running multiple regression with X, M, and X*M  
- Interpreting interaction effects  
- Checking significance of the moderator  
- Plotting interaction patterns (if included)

Outputs typically include:
- Coefficients table with interaction term  
- Model R² comparison  
- Effect interpretation (simple slopes if analyzed further)  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **SPSS**  
  - Linear regression  
  - Logistic regression  
  - Moderation regression (manual interaction term)  
  - Path analysis
- **RStudio**  
  - MARS modeling (`earth`)  
  - Visualization (`ggplot2`)  

---

## 📂 Output
Each project includes:
- Dataset  
- Model outputs  
- Interpretation summaries  
- Diagnostic checks

- R scripts (`.R`)  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
These analyses aim to:
- Explore predictive and causal relationships  
- Understand moderating effects in regression  
- Model nonlinear and structural relationships  
- Provide a comprehensive set of statistical modeling techniques using SPSS and RStudio
