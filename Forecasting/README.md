## 📌 Projects Included

### **1. Forecasting Produksi Pelabuhan Perikanan Pantai Jawa Tengah — Single Moving Average**
This project uses the **Single Moving Average** method to forecast fishery production at coastal fishing ports in Central Java.  
The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing  
- Identifying appropriate moving average window  
- Calculating forecasts  
- Evaluating model performance (MAPE, MAD, MSE)  
- Visualizing actual vs forecasted values

### **2. Forecasting Produksi Ikan Nilai Jawa Tengah — Single Exponential Smoothing**
This project applies **Single Exponential Smoothing (SES)** to estimate fish production in Central Java.  
The process includes:
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Selecting the smoothing constant (α)  
- Generating SES forecasts  
- Measuring accuracy  
- Plotting the forecast results
