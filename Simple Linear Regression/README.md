# Simple Linear Regression — Work Motivation and Employee Performance

This project performs a **Simple Linear Regression** analysis to evaluate the impact of **Work Motivation (X)** on **Employee Performance (Y)**. The analysis was conducted using **SPSS** with a sample size of **70 respondents**.

---

## 🔍 Objective
To determine whether work motivation has a significant influence on employee performance and to measure the strength of that relationship.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Sample size:** 70 employees  
- **Variables:**
  - **X:** Work Motivation  
  - **Y:** Employee Performance  
- Both variables were collected using Likert-scale questionnaire items.

---

## 🛠️ Software Used
- SPSS (for statistical testing and regression modeling)

---

## 🧪 Analysis Steps

### 1. Validity Test  
Evaluates whether each questionnaire item accurately measures its intended construct.  
Items are considered **valid** if the correlation value (*r-hitung*) is greater than *r-tabel*.

### 2. Reliability Test  
Uses **Cronbach’s Alpha**.  
A value above **0.70** indicates that the instrument is **reliable**.

### 3. Normality Test  
Performed using Kolmogorov–Smirnov or Shapiro–Wilk.  
Data is considered normal if the **p-value > 0.05**.

### 4. Linearity Test  
Determines whether the relationship between X and Y is linear.  
Linearity requirement is met if the **significance of deviation from linearity > 0.05**.

### 5. Homoscedasticity Test  
Checked using scatterplots or the Glejser test.  
Data is homoscedastic if no systematic pattern appears in the residuals.

## 📈 Simple Linear Regression Model

The estimated model follows the formula:

\[
Y = a + bX
\]

Where:  
- **a** = constant  
- **b** = regression coefficient  

Statistical outputs include:  
- **t-test** (to check significance of X → Y)  
- **Coefficient of Determination (R²)** (showing how much variation in Y is explained by X)
